# Project1-CS246

## Dorian Jourdan

### Reflection

I did work on the Get Involved page, most of which was done on Tuesday, October 28th.

For this page, I promoted donations, volunteer work, and foster parenting, which are all detailed on the Fox Valley Humane Association's website.

Additionally, I included links to the FVHA website and the other two pages for this project, all of which was formatted consistently with our styles.css folder.

No LLM usage was involved in my part of the project.

### Bugs

I hadn't come across any bugs, as it's a pretty simple web page, but I did struggle with figuring out how to center images. We've tried several different methods in our css but nothing seemed to be changing, so we settled on having images aligned to the left.

### Reflection

I made the Services page along with the Header and Footer as well as most of the styling, With the header and adoption sections being done on Wednesday 10/29 and the footer and other services section being done on 11/2

Since I had already taken CS125 I already had a lot of knowledge regarding HTML and CSS going into this project so I didn't really struggle with anything in this project other than procrastinating until today and having to complete this while sick.

LLM Usage: None

### Bugs

None Know

#### Note: I saw in Dorian's reflection that he had struggled to centering the content so I went ahead and did that.
