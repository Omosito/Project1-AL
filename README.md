### Reflection

I did work on the Get Involved page, most of which was done on Tuesday, October 28th. 

For this page, I promoted donations, volunteer work, and foster parenting, which are all detailed on the Fox Valley Humane Association's website.

Additionally, I included links to the FVHA website and the other two pages for this project, all of which was formatted consistently with our styles.css folder.

No LLM usage was involved in my part of the project.

### Bugs

I hadn't come across any bugs, as it's a pretty simple web page, but I did struggle with figuring out how to center images. We've tried several different methods in our css but nothing seemed to be changing, so we settled on having images aligned to the left.
