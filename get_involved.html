		<h2>Become a Foster</h2>
		<img src="images/foster.webp" alt="Cats">
		<p>Fostering is a way for the FVHA to expand the number of animals it can care for by placing them in the care and shelter of others. Foster parents for these animals must simply welcome these animals into their homes and care for them until a permanent home can be found, all while the FVHA provides food, supplies, and other support to help a foster parent care for them.</p>
