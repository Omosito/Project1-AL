			donations that can help with treating an animal's disease, sponsoring an adoption, or simply feeding the
			animals.</p>

		<h2>Become a Foster</h2>
		<img src="images/foster.webp" alt="Cats">
		<p>Fostering is a way for the FVHA to expand the number of animals it can care for by placing them in the care
			and shelter of others. Foster parents for these animals must simply welcome these animals into their homes
			and care for them until a permanent home can be found, all while the FVHA provides food, supplies, and other
			support to help a foster parent care for them.</p>
